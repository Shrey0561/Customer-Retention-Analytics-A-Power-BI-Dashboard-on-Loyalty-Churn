# Beyond the First Click: A Power BI Deep Dive into Repeat Behavior in E-Commerce

## Overview
Customer acquisition may look promising, but a lack of repeat purchases often signals deeper business challenges. This project investigates repeat behavior patterns, loyalty segmentation, and churn risk using a synthetic e-commerce dataset.
The goal?
To identify what drives customer retention, where potential revenue is at risk, and how strategic focus can improve loyalty outcomes. 
Using SQL, Excel, and Power BI, I built an end-to-end analytical solution that combines cohort segmentation with interactive storytelling.

## Quick Project Snapshot
|Metric                  |Value       |
|------------------------|------------|
|Total Customers         | 4529       |
|Average Age             | 48.1 Years |
|Number of Countries     | 10         |
|Average Order Value     | 108.54     |
|Average Orders/Customer | 10.02      |

## Key Insights
- **Loyalty Breakdown**
  * 45% of customers are classified as loyal; 30% fall into moderately loyal segments.
  * Super loyal customers make up under 10%, but deliver outsized value.

- **Revenue at Risk**
  * Over **$3.49M** in revenue stems from **High Churn Risk** customers.
  * These segments represent 43% of total revenue, a major retention priority.
  
-**Fraud Correlation**
 * Fraudulent behavior is disproportionately present in high churn risk segments.
 * This indicates risk clustering that may require operational intervention.

-**Category-Level Insights**
 * "Home" and "Sports" categories show stronger loyalty indicators.
 * "Fashion" generates high revenue but lower retention, suggesting opportunistic buyers.

## Tools Used 
- **SQL**: Data modeling, cohort logic, fraud, and churn segmentation
- **Excel**: Data Cleaning and Structural Validation
- **Power BI**: Visual storytelling, Interactivity

## Why This Project Matters
Customer retention is a core driver of long-term profitability, yet is often under-analysed. This project provides a structured approach to dissecting loyalty behaviors using tools widely available to business teams.

It demonstrates:
- End-to-end ownership of the data pipeline
- Strategic storytelling through metrics
- Hands-on experience building a dashboard.
