# Beyond the First Click: A Power BI Deep Dive into Repeat Behavior in E-Commerce

## Overview
When customer acquisition looks strong but repeat purchase stall, it's not a conversion problem, it's a loyalty crisis. In this project, I explored behavioral patterns, churn signals, and revenue risk using a simulated e-commerce dataset to answer on key question:
> **What makes customers come back?**
Using SQL, Excel, and Power BI, I created a full stack data solution to dissect loyalty across segments and uncover where retention strategies should focus.

## Quick Project Snapshot
|Metric                  |Value       |
|------------------------|------------|
|Total Customers         | 4529       |
|Average Age             | 48.1 Years |
|Number of Countries     | 10         |
|Average Order Value     | 108.54     |
|Average Orders/Customer | 10.02      |
