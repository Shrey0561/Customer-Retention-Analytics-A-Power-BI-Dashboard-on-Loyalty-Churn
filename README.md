# Beyond the First Click: A Power BI Deep Dive into Repeat Behavior in E-Commerce

## TL;DR
This project uses Power BI, SQL, and Excel to decode loyalty patterns and reveal over $3.49M in at-risk revenue. With cohort segmentation and churn detection, it simulates a data analyst's impact in a B2C setting from fraud signals to high-value customer retention strategies. 

## Overview
Strong acquisition doesn't always translate to long-term growth. This project investigates patterns behind customer retention, segment performance, and behavioral risk within a synthetic e-commerce dataset. Using SQL, Excel, and Power BI, I developed a full-stack analytical solution to pinpoint which customer segments drive value, where drop-off occurs, and how to target high-impact opportunities.
This project is designed to simulate a real-world analytics workflow from raw data to strategic dashboard delivery, mirroring how analysts contribute to business-critical insights in fast-paced environments.

## Key Insights
- **Loyalty Breakdown**
  * 45% of customers are classified as loyal; 30% fall into moderately loyal segments.
  * Super loyal customers make up under 10%, but deliver outsized value.

- **Revenue at Risk**
  * Over **$3.49M** in revenue stems from **High Churn Risk** customers.
  * These segments represent 43% of total revenue, a major retention priority.
  
 - **Fraud Correlation**
 * Fraudulent behavior is disproportionately present in high churn risk segments.
 * This indicates risk clustering that may require operational intervention.

 - **Category-Level Insights**
 * "Home" and "Sports" categories show stronger loyalty indicators.
 * "Fashion" generates high revenue but lower retention, suggesting opportunistic buyers.

## Tools Used 
- **SQL**: Data modeling, cohort logic, fraud, and churn segmentation
- **Excel**: Data Cleaning and Structural Validation
- **Power BI**: Visual storytelling, Interactivity

## Why This Project Matters
Customer retention is a core driver of long-term profitability, yet is often under-analysed. This project provides a structured approach to dissecting loyalty behaviors using tools widely available to business teams.

It demonstrates:
- End-to-end ownership of the data pipeline
- Strategic storytelling through metrics
- Hands-on experience building a dashboard.
